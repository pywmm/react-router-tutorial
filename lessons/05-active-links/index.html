</style>
<p>1. One way that Link is different from a is that it knows if the path it links to is active so you can style it differently.</p>
<p>2.You can also use an active class name instead of inline-styles.</p>
<p>3. We will use a spread operator here, the three dots. It clones our props and in this use case it clones activeClassName to our desired component for us to benefit from.</p>
